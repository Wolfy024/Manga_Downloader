# Manga_Downloader



This only download from Mangafreak.net and stores in pdf form.<br>
Nothing very advanced, you will have to tinker in main file and change link and end chapter var each time, you wanna download some other thing.



To get the links.<br>Go to Mangafreak.net and search the manga you wanna download, after that copy the first download link. In my case, let's say<br>http://images.mangafreak.net:8080/downloads/Kanojo_Okarishimasu_1 and after remove the last number from the link.<br>So, http://images.mangafreak.net:8080/downloads/Kanojo_Okarishimasu_<br> This will be the link, you wanna give as input.
